# Quantum-Safe-Disk-Encryption
This is an educational project that demonstrates a hybrid encryption architecture using symmetric data encryption and post-quantum key protection. Disk data is encrypted with a DEK, while the DEK is secured using a Kyber-style key encapsulation and recoverable through secure recovery mechanisms..
